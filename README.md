# Proyecto-Robot
First complete game that i've developed on my own. without tutorial or walktrough. 
In this game the player needs to activate certain towers in order to decrease air polution and save the world, in order to achieve this the player must destroy garbage and fight cockroaches to decrease the polution rate. It's a very simple game and it was
the final project of a lenghty course about game programming on Unity
